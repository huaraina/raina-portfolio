        <h1>First project: Puzzle Cube</h1>
        <p>This is the rules and requirements for the project. I don't really know what to call it. <a href="/projects/Puzzle Cube/assets/rulesetc.pdf">Link to pdf</a>.</p>
        <h3>1. What is our problem?</h3> <!-- answering project questions -->
        <dl>
            <dt>Client:</dt>
            <dd>Fine Office Furniture, Inc.</dd>
            <dt>Target Customer:</dt>
            <dd>Ages: High school aged</dd>
            <dt>Designer:</dt>
            <dd>Raina (this is on the internet I'm not writing my full name)</dd>
            <dt>Problem:</dt>
            <dd>Our client, Fine Office Furniture Incorporated, is a local furniture manufacturing company. It currently throws away tens of thousands of 1/2" wooden cubes. The material is expensive and the loss the company suffers is great.</dd>
            <dt>Design Statement:</dt>
            <dd>Fine Office Furniture, Inc. wants to reuse the leftover cubes. It is to be used as raw material for desk toys. Our goal as designers is to design, build, test, document, and present a 3d puzzle made from the excess material. The puzzle must be challenging but still solvable for high school students.</dd>
            <dt>Criteria:</dt>
            <dd>The puzzle needs to be made up of 27 blocks (think a 3x3 grid as a cube, including the always invisible middle segment).</dd>
            <dd>The puzzle must contain 5 pieces.</dd>
            <dd>Each piece may be made up of 4 to 6 blocks.</dd>
            <dt>Constraints:</dt>
            <dd>No two parts can be the same.</dd>
            <dd>At least some parts should interlock.</dd>
            <dd>No straight pieces.</dd>
        </dl>

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p class="smallP">This cube project was very fun an a great practice for both CAD and web design. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS, whilst also practicing my CAD skills. I learned how to use Inventor presentations and assemblies which was pretty cool. The solution wasn't too difficult, it took most people only a few minutes to find it. The design of each part was prety fun to do as I could just open a new Inventor file and build it in like 20 seconds.</p>
                    <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
                    <p class="smallP">Overall most people were able to solve the puzzle pretty quickly, it wasn't too hard and had a few parts that could be considered challenging. It took on average 2.25 hints for each person. On average it took 221.25 seconds to solve the puzzle, and with clues incorporated, it took 288.75 (or on the chart, it took 288.8) seconds.</p>
