        <h1>Second project: Traffic Light (SITE CONSTRUCTION NOT DONE!!!)</h1>
        <p>We basically just had to create a way to improve our school. We chose highway traffic.</p>
        <h3>1. Research</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <dl>
            <dt>How do we make our school a better place if we don't know what is wrong?</dt>
            <dd>Survey students from our school and see what they need.</dd>
            <dt>What is wrong?</dt>
            <dd>Hallway traffic is a major issue, and we chose that as our focus.</dd>
            <dt>What makes people's lives difficult?</dt>
            <dd>Traffic and jams in the hallways causes many students to be late for class.</dd>
            <dt>Whose life is difficult?</dt>
            <dd>As said above, many students in the school (and maybe teachers too) have trouble with getting to class.</dd>
        </dl>

                    <p class="smallP">Most people get to class late, potentially due to traffic in hallways. There are many factors, however, so it should be noted that most people followed the same route daily. A contradiction to that may be that one might have only one path to get to class.</p>

                    <h4>Traffic light reflection: first complex cad project</h4>
                    <p class="smallP">I like the simplicity of the original design. It is simple and unique. It also would be very easy to mass produce. On the second design (the one I did), I made it more recognizable, improved measurements (original design had very wacky and irregular measurements for things that were supposed to be equidistant [think 1.10 and 1.25 as 2 distances that were supposed to be the same but weren’t]), made dimensions unified, improved visibility, improved aesthetics, and added functionality. I would like to work on more practical things like this. One thing could be like designing parts of a moving thing or just maintaining skills. Our design is, in theory, more helpful and could control hallway traffic. If I could have made the inside hollow, I could have put electronics in it  and made a working stoplight. Maybe I’ll do that one day… In reality, they might not be too helpful as most teenagers would probably just ignore it and not care enough to follow them.
