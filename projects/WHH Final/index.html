        <h1>World History Final Project: Southern Europe</h1>
        <p>Raina's World History Final, not too much about it.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Part I:</h3>
            <p>One of the more recent interesting events to happen in (roughly) Southern Europe was the discovery of incredibly detailed ancient paintings. The paintings in the Chauvet Cave were found in northern Spain by Jean-Marie Chauvet. Experts have estimated that they were made sometime between 32,000 BCE and 26,000 BCE. These paintings shocked the world as modern humans thought that the techniques used were invented in the last 500 years, but instead have existed for tens of thousands.</p>

                        <h4>Similarities</h4>
                        <p class="smallP">The people who made the cave paintings had (likely) invented these advanced technologies in art. As the cave was untouched for so long, it is also an amazing example of record keeping behaviors in incredibly ancient societies. Their art style is relatively similar to some of ours from the last few centuries that have now been rediscovered.</p>

                        <h4>Differences</h4>
                        <p class="smallP">Despite being amazing works of art, modern record keeping and technologies are much different than those from roughly 32,000 years ago. Ours now include microscopic transistors on pieces of silicon (Solid State Drives), magnetic discs (Hard Disc Drive), discs with tiny divots (CD/DVD/Bluray), and much more. We also have books now to mark down our history. Our technology is far more advanced than theirs was.</p>

            <h3>Part II:</h3>
            <p>More recently, around the turn from before the common era to the common era, Caesar Augustus made some huge changes in his rule. Caesar Augustus was born on 23 September, 63, and died 19 August, 14 CE. He was blood related to Julius Caesar, and was seen as his heir. In 27 BCE, Augustus converted the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire, making himself the first emperor of said empire. This event began the era known as Pax Romana, or “Roman peace”. This era later ended in 117 CE, lasting about 2 centuries.</p>

                        <h4>Similarities</h4>
                        <p class="smallP">You’ve heard the saying “all roads lead to Rome” which references how they (the Romans) built quite a lot of roads during the Empire’s existence. Well they’re not the only ones to do that. The Mauryan Empire, which existed between 322-185 BCE, in northwest India. The third Mauryan emperor, Ashoka also built quite a lot of roads with the intention of trade. From Augustus’ self-written deeds, during his seventh time as Consul, he “rebuilt the Flaminian road from the city to Ariminum and all the bridges except the Mulvian and Minucian” (The Deeds of the Divine Augustus, translated 1998).</p>

                    <div class="photoDesc">
                        <h4>Differences</h4>
                        <p class="smallP">While they were similar in road design, they were incredibly far apart, in time, and location. As I mentioned before, Maurya was located in India whilst Rome was located in, well, Rome. This huge location distance affects the surrounding geography and how the cultures evolved. Maurya’s location being the Indian Subcontinent, it has a tropical-monsoon climate and a tropical wet-dry climate. Rome’s location being in Italy and the Mediterranean, means that it has a temperate-mediterranean climate, warm and dry summers, and wet winters. They also existed around 200 years apart meaning that a lot of technological advancements happened between the two.</p>
