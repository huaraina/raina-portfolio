        <h3>Distortion of Length and Distance</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>Fencing is a combat-based sport involving swords (often called “blades”) and distance. Some even consider it to be “chess with swords”, due to how much thinking is involved. There are many factors that go into Fencing. One major factor is distance. Distance is incredibly important as it allows you to get closer and farther from your opponent. All bladework (one of the other factors) relies on the exploitation of the previous factor, distance. An example of this would be using your blade to go around the opponent’s blade while moving forward at the same time. This event allows you to enter the opponent’s target area whilst gaining control and being able to score on the opponent.</p>
        <p>There are other ways to exploit distance. One example of these techniques would be a stop-hit. A stop-hit uses a blade extension at the same exact time as a retreat. This allows you to get into distance, leave it, and score. Often it happens when you’re already in distance and wanting to leave. Another example of using distance to score is a specific move called flèche. A flèche is when you go off balance onto your front foot, jump, land, and then go into a run. The run doesn’t do much as you are supposed to score when you land, it is just to prevent a collision. It isn’t used much and is more of a surprise attack. It is a way to quickly gain distance while scaring the opponent. Many scare tactics exist, often it involves a loud noise, as Fencing is often quiet (until you score). Sometimes fencers get too close and have to hit behind them to get the opponent. This is called infighting. Each of the 3 blades have their own movement specific attacks, their own rules, and many of their own niches.</p>
