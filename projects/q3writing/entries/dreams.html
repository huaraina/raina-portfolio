        <h3>Return of Past Dreams</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>In the next 2 years, I would like to do higher level math classes. I want to finish learning Polish and improve in Fencing. Regarding Fencing, I have gotten pretty decent for my skill, and I hope to continue improving. I enjoy Fencing épée (one of the three weapons), so continuing and maybe even doing tournaments would be really fun. I plan on doing engineering related work after high school. Currently I like to do CAD-related engineering. I also want to travel around the world, see cool things, and learn about other cultures. Interesting places to end up could be like random countries or just building rooftops (there’s many cool things you can see from rooftops). I think taking risks could be very beneficial, as they give space to improve. I don’t think I’ll be an incredibly successful billionaire (nor do I want to be), but I feel like being with friends and people I love would be amazing.</p>
        <p>Next year I am going to take a language course, because I didn’t this year. I am not fully sure why I started learning Polish but it’s pretty interesting. Words are really long and the grammar is somewhat complicated and quite different. However it is a really un challenge. I have some friends that speak Polish so if I am struggling with it, I could ask for help. Maybe I’ll start Fencing professionally and get to see the world through that. For classes next year I want to take precalculus (I also kind of have to as it is the “path” I am taking for class levels), English 2 Honors, maybe statistics, and whatever the continuation of TE11 is. At least I won’t have to take Health again. Maybe I’ll take Project Management 2/ So far it has been pretty interesting.</p>
