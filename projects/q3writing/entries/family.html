        <h3>Contrast of Relatives and Family</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>Regardless of direct relation, biological or not, people can still be, and still are, family. Family is incredibly important to human nature. We are social creatures, so having people that you can frequently associate with is super important. In the scene from <i>In The Heights</i> by Lin Manuel Miranda, we see a small amount of the complex interpersonal relations between the inhabitants of Washington Heights, a bit of the culture, and how involved they are with each other. Washington Heights appears to be an ethnic enclave of people from Latin America, so a lot of similarities do exist. In larger less urban areas, diversity in culture is much greater, and people are less interconnected. This leads to less socialness between people and less “family” to form.</p>
        <p>As I live 600 miles away from most of my family (relatives), it can feel quite disconnected. However, I have a lot of friends where I live where I live and they support me as if I were family. Even some of my friends that live in other countries are pretty close with me. Even if I’m not with relatives, I’ve still got lots of support and family. This reminds me of a concept from a scifi-horror game I played last year, <i>Signalis</i>. The main character, Elster, is separated from her lover, and fights her way to rejoin her. At the end of the game you appear before a door, and a dialogue appears asking if you want to, “Go home?”. This little dialogue represents Elster’s need to have both relatives and friends in her life.</p>
