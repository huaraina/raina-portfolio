        <h3>Reflection on Writing</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>I think the writer’s notebook may have helped me feel better about my writing. In the past I used to not be the most confident in the writing, often doubting myself and rewriting. I still do this sometimes, but the writer’s notebook definitely has helped me improve. The improvements I’ve seen have often just been going with what I’ve written, and maybe going back and fixing a few small errors. I don’t think I am the most skilled writer ever, and I definitely have many flaws, but I still try. I want to improve my writing, especially creative based writing. Analytical writing and ACES based responses aren’t super challenging for me, but theme statements definitely are. It can be hard for me to interpret the meaning of text without things to imply what is happening (i.e. character’s thoughts and emotions). Another thing is just not knowing what would work well as a theme statement and what would be detrimental.</p>
        <p>My piece on family and interpersonal connections could be my best/most effective piece of writing from my entries. I like the concept of communication and how humans interpret and interact with different things. I find the web of connections between people really interesting, so I was quite excited to write about it. I also think that entry was pretty well written and explained my thoughts on non-related family. The concept of distant relatives versus close family really stood out to me too.</p>
        <p>I don’t think anyone is a perfect writer. No one is going to have the most perfectly focused and organized writing and points. You can always expand on vocabulary, potentially even create some of your own (like how Shakespeare created over 1,000 words). It is always good to go back over old work and update it to be more understandable as your writing improves. Elaboration on topics is always a really strong point that many people should be willing to do. Personally I do not think I am the best at writing, nowhere near there, but I do think the writer’s notebook has and will continue to help me grow as a writer.</p>
