        <h3>Madly in Love or Just Plain Madness?</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>In the play Romeo and Juliet, there is a recurring theme of intense love leading to madness and desperate actions. The love shared by Romeo and Juliet leads to ignorance, risk-taking, and daring feats. At several points, Romeo risks his and his family's safety by sneaking into the opposing family's parties, homes, gardens, and more. During the second scene of Act II, Romeo makes his way through the Capulet's courtyard in order to find Juliet at her balcony. Upon reaching this location and calling out for her, a conversation begins. Juliet asks Romeo as to how he arrived at the balcony, and he replies, "(Love) lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes," (2.2.86). Instead of answering truthfully, Romeo deflects and states that love told him the directions. Romeo's use of love as a "guide" personifies the emotion of love. He knew that sneaking into the Capulet's estate would be a dangerous idea, but he still did it so that he could see her again. His love was so intense that he was willing to risk his own safety to be with her.</p>
        <p>Furthering the concept of Romeo's disregard of the inter-family hatred, he believes that Juliet's opinions of him are much stronger than her family's. When Juliet warns that her family may spot and kill him, Romeo informs her that her reciprocation of love is simply more valuable. He exclaims, "My life were better ended by their hate / Than death prorogu√®d, wanting of thy love" (2.2.82-83). Romeo uses the previous character foil (such as the events of Act I Scene I) of the two families to detail how he would feel if she denied his love. Stating that her denial would be worse than death also points back to the theme of risky antics resulting from intense love. Romeo consistently puts himself at risk of death or serious bodily harm so that he can spend time with Juliet.</p>
        <p>Although he takes more of the risks, Romeo isn't the only character to use figurative language in the balcony sequence. Juliet's thoughts and opinions were often spoken through statements, but some had hyperboles mixed in. Informing Romeo that she wants him to stay alive, Juliet says "I would not for the world they saw thee here," (2.2.79). In this, she replies in a hyperbole, stating that she would do anything she could to end the conflict so that Romeo would not be spotted and killed. Romeo's statements of attractions and desires are not in vain as Juliet appears to reciprocate those feelings as she progresses the conversation. Whilst the play is a tragedy about two lovers being separated by their family's mutual hatred, it also has comedic effects due to the ignorance of danger. Both Romeo and Juliet show signs of an intense love for each other, one that would progress past death, even death caused by the two families.</p>
