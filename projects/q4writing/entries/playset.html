        <h3>A Chilly Day to Play</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p class="flIndent">It was a chilly day, maybe January or February. The frozen air pierced our lungs, making it hard to breathe. This cold also made our noses leak. It was quite unpleasant. On that play-set we swang, we were fiddling with our toys, having a grand old time. The metal bars were cold to the touch, sharp on our fingertips. I fell off the structure and landed on the soft yellow ground. The material of the ground was strange, a weird squishy rubber. The structure was rather brutal, a few metal poles welded together and attached to another structure.</p>
        <p class="flIndent">We played there a lot, discussed Rubik’s cubes and had a lot of fun times. My friend Anderson was kind. He was soft-spoken but had very interesting ideas. He was medium height for our age, maybe around 5 feet? Doesn’t matter much. My other friend, Max, was also kind… for the most part. His jet-black hair had a bright sheen from the sun’s rays. Anderson’s Rubik’s cube was very vibrant against the metal bars. Clinging to the cold, hard bars, we swung around. Soon they spoke up. As soon as the words left Max’s mouth, time slowed. Frozen in thought, I could not reply. What he said completely shocked me to my core.</p>
