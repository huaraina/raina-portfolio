        <h3>Reform and Analysis</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>I really enjoyed writing the Literary Analysis essay. I feel very proud about it because I could write about a topic I was interested and curious about. It was also fun to write, as the use of brainstorming and graphic organizers helped me display my thoughts adequately when writing. I also really liked the “Four Skinny Trees” IWT prompt as it allowed me to explore the concept of security and parts of my past that really stand out to me. I think my writing has improved since the start of the semester, as my formal and informal writing reads more smoothly. Because of these improvements in my writing skills, my most recent document, the Literary Analysis paper, is one that I am very proud of.</p>
        <p>One piece I did not like as much was the IWT topic “Conformity vs. Rebellion”, specifically the second prompt. My responses to the questions were pretty weak, didn’t go into enough depth, and read poorly. I tried to write about differences between leaders of the American Civil Rights movement (specifically Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X) and how some tried to conform while others tried to rebel. I feel as though I could go more in depth on that in the future, as it is an interesting topic. If I were to do more research and planning, I could probably write a paper on how people act differently based on their personal beliefs.</p>
        <p>A topic that I would be interested in writing about would definitely be about the first unit, Home and Family. An analysis or personal response to how Walter lost the money in A Raisin in the Sun would be really cool. It could ask something like, “Have you ever been when you felt completely lost and that you had no control?”. This topic is interesting to me because there are many reasons someone would feel this way and psychology interests me a lot.</p>
