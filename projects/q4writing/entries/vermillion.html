        <h3>Enlightening Vermillion Haze</h3> <!-- pose research questions -->
        <p>For the first few years of my consciousness, I was incredibly interested in space and space travel. These topics were really fun to learn about and always inspired me. An item that I would say represents me would be my telescope. When I first got that telescope I had no idea how to use it. At all. No clue. I tried many times to figure out this magical light tube, but it never worked. Every time I tried, it would reflect my eye or eyelash. No matter what I did, my attempts would always fail. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. This conundrum stumped me for a long while, eventually leading to me giving up my interest in astronomy.</p>
        <p>In October 2022, I tried again. Apparently, a lunar eclipse was soon to occur. At around 5 am on November 8th, I stumbled outside; the telescope packed up into my backpack. The bright red sheen over the moon was incredibly beautiful. I set up my telescope and took a look. The telescope zoomed in and showed the craters, slightly darker than the rest of the surface. It was the first time I ever correctly used that telescope. I took a few pictures of this event, I’ll link some below. Some of these pictures came out incredibly well, detailing the beautiful amber and ruby hues that came off the moon. This event helped me to regain that spark of imagination and curiosity that I initially had all those years ago. That telescope that sat in the corner of my room, untouched, was finally being used. Using it more recently, I’ve taken even more beautiful photos of the moon.</p>
